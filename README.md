# PIDController_ScaraRobot
A PID Controller for each joint using Trajectory planned was designed in the Simulink MATLAB.
I did trial and error to adjust PID controller gains.
The coefficients of the PID controller calculated by solving stability, transient response and steady state response of plant using parameters of jointâ€™s motor.
